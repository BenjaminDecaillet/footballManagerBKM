# TO be able to access the application which is securised you have to add users to your local wildfly server
# The roles to be implemented to tests all cases are "president", "trainer", "player".
# In our example we have used the following users {user:President - role:president},
# {user:Trainer - role:trainer},{user:Player - role:player}
